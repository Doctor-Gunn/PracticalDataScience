# Setting up your Github repo and local copy

To get setup you first need to fork the main repository that can be found here.

https://github.com/JackStat/PracticalDataScience.

In the top right you should see the fork button

When you have it forked go to your copy of the Github repo and copy the link for cloning

Now you need to use Terminal (Mac) or the git client (Windows) to execute the clone (copy the project to you machine). The first step is to pick the folder that you want to clone into. I recommend using Documents and you can execute this command

```{bash}
cd ~/Documents
```

Now you just need to git clone.

```{bash}
git clone <paste the clone url from the image above>
```
